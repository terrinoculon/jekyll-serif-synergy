As management strategists, the Synergy HR Consulting Group employs the _Psycho cybernetic_ approach to evolve pragmatic solutions that resonate to the essential human & organizational aspirations and trigger success spirals. 

## Our Philosophy

Our philosophy and mission is based on two basic premises; one is that in the ultimate analysis the human being or an organization is an energy system and any true learning should result in unleashing the fullest human / organizational potential. The second premise is a realization that underneath the current complex & chaotic political & socio-economic scenario there is an evolutionary order. There is always a pattern lurking in the deeper layers of the constantly evolving organizations. The challenge is to explore these and uncover inner harmony and insights into the processes of creating empowered organizations which are cost and quality leaders globally.
